⭐ **IMPORTANT**: Always **star** the original repository first!

1. **Import as Private Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub → **Import repository**
   - Clone URL: `https://github.com/PIROXTG/AutoWiper.git`
   - Make it **PRIVATE** (crucial for security)
   - **DO NOT FORK** - Others can see your environment variables if you fork publicly

2. **Switch to Koyeb Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout koyeb
   ```
   Or during import, specify branch: `koyeb`

3. **Deploy on Koyeb**:
   - Sign up at [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/)
   - Click **"Create App"** → **"Deploy from Git"**
   - Select your **private** imported repository
   - **Choose branch**: `koyeb` (important!)
   - Choose **Docker** deployment method
   - Set **Service Type**: `Web Service` (for web app support)
   - **Port**: Set to `8080` (default web server port)
   - Add **Environment Variables** (see configuration below)

4. **Access Web Dashboard**:
   - After deployment, you'll get a public URL
   - Visit the URL to see your bot's web dashboard
   - Monitor system stats, uptime, and bot health in real-time

⚠️ **Security Warning**: Never store credentials in public repositories. If you accidentally push sensitive data, immediately rotate all tokens and session strings.

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Security Guidelines
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Never fork this repository publicly - use GitHub's **Import** feature instead
- Always make your repository **PRIVATE** when importing
- **Never commit** `config.py` with real credentials to any repository
- Use **environment variables only** for production deployments
- **Use HTTPS only** for web dashboard access in production
- If credentials are accidentally exposed, immediately:
  1. Revoke the bot token via @BotFather
  2. Generate a new session string
  3. Delete and recreate the compromised repository
- **DISCLAIMER**: The repository owner is not responsible for compromised accounts due to improper handling of credentials

### Important Notes
- The bot requires **delete message permissions** in target chats
- **Pinned messages** are preserved and won't be deleted
- Only messages older than the specified duration are removed
- The bot uses a user account session for broader permissions
- **Web dashboard** is public by default - no sensitive data is displayed

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not deleting messages?**
- Ensure the user account has admin/delete permissions
- Check if chat IDs are correct (negative numbers for groups/channels)
- Verify the session string is valid

**Web dashboard not loading? (Koyeb branch)**
- Check if you're using the correct branch (`koyeb`)
- Verify `PORT` environment variable is set correctly
- Ensure platform supports web services
- Check deployment logs for aiohttp errors

**Connection errors?**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Ensure Telegram isn't blocked in your region

**Bot stops working on free hosting?**
- Make sure you're using the `koyeb` branch (has auto-ping)
- Verify web service is properly configured
- Check if platform requires keep-alive requests

**Deployment fails?**
- Ensure you're using the correct branch for your platform
- Check all required environment variables are set
- Verify `requirements.txt` matches your branch
